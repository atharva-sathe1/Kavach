(Developed by the students of PES MCOE, Pune belonging to Group ID 4 - Atharva Sathe, Neha Wakhare, Ishwari Dubewar, Pranjal Shinde, and Siddhesh Lohekar)



Kavach - The app incorporates a range of features to address various safety concerns and empower users to stay safe in their daily lives. One of the key features of the app is GPS sharing with registered contacts, allowing users to share their real-time location with trusted individuals. This feature can be activated discreetly in case of an emergency, providing an added layer of security and facilitating a quick response from friends or family members. The app also activates a loud siren that can alert the people nearby to the imminent danger.


In addition to these emergency features, the app provides users with access to a range of safety tips and information. This includes advice on how to stay safe in various situations, self-defence techniques, and information on local support services and resources. Furthermore, the app includes a database of helpline numbers for quick access to emergency services, support organizations, and other relevant agencies. Users can easily find and contact these services directly from within the app, streamlining the process of seeking help in times of need. 


Overall, we've developed the app to serve as a powerful tool for enhancing personal safety and providing peace of mind to its users. Its combination of GPS sharing, safety tips, helpline numbers, and emergency services integration makes it a comprehensive solution for women's safety in today's world.
